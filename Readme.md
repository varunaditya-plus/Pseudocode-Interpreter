# Pseudocode Interpreter

This is a web-based **CIE Pseudocode editor** and interpreter for students.

Created using solely Vite and Javascript, this editor runs, compiles and shows errors in real time for</br>
easy debugging. This was made to help students learn Pseudocode for their iGCSEs.

## üìú About the project
My pseudocode editor (untitled), is a small project I build in a few days to try to teach myself how coding languages are built at a lower level, and how pseudocode, a language I have always been infuriated with, actually works.
<br><br>
I tried editors like [pseudonaja](https://editor.pseudonaja.app/), [pseudocode.pro](https://pseudocode.pro/editor) and [igpc](https://cs.coursemo.com/igpc/) but they either used pyodide to compile the pseudocode üíÄ (pseudonaja), were slow, bloated and messy, or had a UI I didn't like.
<br><br>
When I built my pseudocode editor, I tried to base the design off of Trae (inspired by JetBrains Fleet) to make the site look and feel as similar as my actual code editor which I use on a daily basis. In my opinion, the final result looks clean, works well, and runs fast. The only issue I have found is that it will eat up your RAM till extinction if you run an infinite while loop.
<br><br>
Overall, I loved coding this and I learned a lot about how coding languages work. In the future I might add more languages like python or javascript, and add accounts to save code projects.
